Once upon a time there was a cs student named Deb. 
She still  remembers her very first day in cs 200.
At that time, she only knew Python. As a result, she was annoyed
by the fact that she had to declare variable types. However, she got
used to it quickly and excelled in cs 200.
Then she became more interested in CS and felt more confident about coding. 
Eventually, she decided to become a professor to ensure her students would feel
the same frustration she once did.
